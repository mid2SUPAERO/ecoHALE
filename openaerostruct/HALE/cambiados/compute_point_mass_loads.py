class ComputePointMassLoads(om.ExplicitComponent):
    """
    Compute the loads on the structure due to point masses.
    The current method adds loads and moments to all of the structural nodes, but
    the nodes closest to the point masses receive proportionally larger loads.

    Parameters
    ----------
    point_mass_locations[n_point_masses, 3] : numpy array
        XYZ location for each point mass in the global frame.
    point_masses[n_point_masses] : numpy array
        Actual magnitude of each point mass, in same order as point_mass_locations.
    nodes[ny, 3] : numpy array
        Flattened array with coordinates for each FEM node.
    load_factor : float
        Load factor for the flight point. Multiplier on the effects of gravity.

    Returns
    -------
    nodal_weightings[n_point_masses, ny] : numpy array
        The normalized weighting factor for each node. The closest nodes have the
        greatest weighting, while farther away nodes have less.
    loads_from_point_masses[ny, 6] : numpy array
        The actual loads array that will be added to the total loads array.
        This is cumulative and includes the forces and moments from all point masses.
